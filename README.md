Originally this project was designed to track AV equipment at my first job. 
Since we had an alternative method for tracking equipment I decided to make the repository public and showcase it as a side project.
This project uses HTML and CSS to design the page, JS to load data and a mix of AJAX and PHP to update data on the remote JSON file.
